# Define when the workflow should run:
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]        # Runs when code is pushed to the main branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main", "dependabot/**" ]  # Runs on PRs targeting main (including Dependabot PRs).
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'         # Runs weekly at midnight UTC on Sunday.
